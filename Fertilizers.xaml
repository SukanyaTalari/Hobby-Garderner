                    <TextBlock Height="110"  Margin="10,2,0,0" TextWrapping="Wrap" FontSize="13" Text="1. Liquid Fertilizers - Liquid fertilizers are usually added to your watering can every time or every other time we water. Some formulas can be used for feeding our plants once or twice a month. One of the best things about liquid fertilizer is we have a lot of control over how much is being applied. We can stop fertilizing during dormant periods and be confident that there is not any fertilizer still being released in the soil. On the other hand, the downside is that we have to remember to add fertilizer to the water at the appropriate time which is easier said than done."/>
                    <TextBlock Height="90"  Margin="10,0,0,0" TextWrapping="Wrap" FontSize="13" Text="2. Granular Fertilizers - Granular fertilizers are mixed into the soil. They work especially well when we are first potting a plant and can mix the granules throughout the pot. Granules are a little tricky to use with indoor plants because they release all their nutrients at once when the plant is watered so it's not easy to tell how much the plants are getting. Follow the directions on the package very carefully so you do not over or under-feed the plant."/>
                    <TextBlock Height="110"  Margin="10,0,0,0" TextWrapping="Wrap" FontSize="13" Text="3. Slow-Release Fertilizers - Slow-release fertilizers come in many forms, including spikes, pods, and capsules. They have a time-release coating that allows the nutrients to slowly make their way into the soil. This type of fertilizer works better in small pots because we do not have to worry about nutrient distribution as much since there is less area to cover. One of the downsides to slow-release fertilizers is that there is no way of knowing how quickly the nutrients are dissolving. Ideally, the time-release shell is keeping it somewhat even but we never really know."/>

These gardens create a sense of community among neighbors who are increasingly disconnected with each other. They create opportunities to provide healthy options in neighborhoods that are often food scarce. For example, in some remote rural areas, the nearest grocery store is prohibitively far away, and many residents rely on pre-packaged food from the gas stations and convenience stores. In these communities, such a garden is critical to the survival of the people in providing a well-rounded diet. The people working in the garden benefit from exercise and sunshine, as well as the therapeutic benefits of working in a garden. Weeding a garden is particularly effective in stress relief and provides mental health benefits to participants. Learning about the ways plants grow and the best conditions to help them thrive can provide the mental and intellectual stimulation of cultivating a new skill. Also, a community garden can change the culture of a neighborhood by providing a shared interest and activity that brings people together. One of the biggest benefits to a community garden is in creating a culture of self-sustainability. In a low-income neighborhood, a community garden may mean saving enough on groceries to provide for other household needs. People have become more and more separated from traditional food ways, and community gardens can replace the kind of independent living we once knew when everyone had their own backyard garden. Environmental benefits may be the increase of pollinator plants that can improve conditions for bees and other endangered pollinators. Plants also reduce the overall temperature compared to paved spaces, so these gardens are especially beneficial in urban areas. The environment of a community is improved by having an element of natural beauty so that rather than empty lots in some neighborhoods, the space between buildings can be filled with flowers or even food."/>

It is important to get feedback from garden participants because the nature of a community garden is collective and their voices should be included. Once a garden space or location has been established, it may help to identify the population the garden hopes to serve. For example, a community garden located in a low-income neighborhood may be intended to serve the residents of that neighborhood. The community garden connected to a food bank or soup kitchen might serve the clients who need those services. A community garden may also serve to provide income potential to participants by providing a space where they can grow produce to sell at a farmer's market, or flowers to sell in bars and restaurants downtown. A community center or after-school group may create a community garden specifically catered to teaching youth about healthy eating and growing plants."/>-->
