These gardens create a sense of community among neighbors who are increasingly disconnected with each other. They create opportunities to provide healthy options in neighborhoods that are often food scarce. For example, in some remote rural areas, the nearest grocery store is prohibitively far away, and many residents rely on pre-packaged food from the gas stations and convenience stores. In these communities, such a garden is critical to the survival of the people in providing a well-rounded diet."/>

                    <TextBlock Height="60"  Margin="10,0,0,0" TextWrapping="Wrap" FontSize="13" Text="One of the biggest benefits to a community garden is in creating a culture of self-sustainability. In a low-income neighborhood, a community garden may mean saving enough on groceries to provide for other household needs."/>
                    <TextBlock Height="60"  Margin="10,0,0,0" TextWrapping="Wrap" FontSize="13" Text="People have become more and more separated from traditional food ways, and community gardens can replace the kind of independent living we once knew when everyone had their own backyard garden."/>

Once a garden space or location has been established, it may help to identify the population the garden hopes to serve."/>
                    <TextBlock Height="40"  Margin="10,0,0,0" HorizontalAlignment="Right" TextWrapping="Wrap" FontSize="13" Text="For example, a community garden located in a low-income neighborhood may be intended to serve the residents of that neighborhood."/>
